# 0.1.0

This is the FIRST build of PyRoomStudio we’re releasing to the public. This is a basic working prototype to achieve ONE goal:

- To test and experience how room geometry (shape and size) alone can affect the sound signature of a room.

In this build, you are able to :

- Import a simple room mesh model.
- Place a sound source in the middle of the room and hear what it will sound like if you are standing right next to it.

We have our first working graphic user interface (GUI) layout. Many of the buttons will be “greyed-out” (not clickable), and they will be enabled (or changed) as we roll out more features.
